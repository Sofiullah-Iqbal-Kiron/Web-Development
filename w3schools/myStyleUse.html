After a long survey, I fixed the bug. Currently I faced a new problem, "border" property is not supporting. Let's start the journey right now. Here is just very bare bones html structure. Inherit: The element inherit propertiy form the parent element. Margin property sequecne is top-right-bottom-left: Means, clock-wise from top. You can put the values in "px", "pt" or "cm" units. '%' units are also applicable here thats mean X% of the current element and "auto" value also. The CSS "padding" properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. CSS class name does not contain any empty space. "letter-spacing: -2px;" mene newa jay. And "!important" overrides any CSS internal command to execute this whatever happens.</b>
            Text formatting:
            <ol>
                <li>text-indent</li>

                <li>RGB(int red, int green, int blue) in [0, 255] interval. If value of all parameters are same than it will produce different sets of gray. All 255 is white and all 0 is black.</li>
                <li>RGBA(int red[0, 255], int green[0, 255], int blue[0, 255], int absolute[0, 1])</li>
