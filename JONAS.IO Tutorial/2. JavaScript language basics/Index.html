        Now I gonna write "Inline" scripts inside "script" tag.
        <script>
            console.log("Hello, World!");
        </script>
        Now let's write an external script.
        <script src="ScriptOne.js"></script>
        JS is lightweight means, the language codes doesn't eat up much memory in the computer and that it has relatively simple syntax and features. Cross Platform means the language can be use in multiple platform and systems, that is it just not use in web pages. Object-Oriented. Dynamic typed. Here all numbers are simply float numbers even they look like an integer number. I'm gonna show it to you a bit later. The variable name cannot starts with number or any symbols except dollar sign and underscore. The value changes dynamically.
