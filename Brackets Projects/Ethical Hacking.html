       <h2>Hacking Lab</h2>
        <p>
            Therefore you need a lab or a place where you can practice and experiment whit the things that you are going to learn in the course.

        <h2 class="MACAddressChangerHeading">MAC Address Changer</h2>
        <p>
            Now like I said, the course is going to be highly practical. I'm gonno teach you everything with example. The first program we gonna write is a "MAC Address Changer". MAC stands for "Media Access Control". MAC is a permanent-physical and unique address assigned to the network interfaces by the device manufacturer. If you don't see any errors that means the command got executed properly.
